# ShardEvents - Blockchain-Powered Event Platform
## Description

ShardEvents is a platform designed for organizing and participating in various community events for Shardchain. Users can engage in events listed on the platform, and upon closure, the prize pool is distributed among the winners.

## Problem Statement

In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain technologies, many individuals interested in exploring decentralized applications (dApps) are often hindered by the complexities of traditional Ethereum-based EOA wallets. Additionally, organizers of blockchain events face challenges such as delayed or dishonest distribution of prizes, negatively impacting the overall user experience.

## Solution - ShardEvents

### Gasless and User-Friendly Wallets

ShardEvents addresses the challenge faced by non-crypto users by implementing account abstraction. Users can seamlessly interact with the platform using a gasless and user-friendly wallet generated through their email ID. This eliminates the need for users to create and manage Ethereum EOA wallets, simplifying the onboarding process for individuals new to blockchain technologies.

### Trust and Fairness Through Smart Contracts

To mitigate issues related to delayed or unfair distribution of prizes, ShardEvents introduces a unique approach. Organizers are required to stake the prize amount when creating an event. This ensures a transparent and trustless process where, upon completion of the event, the smart contract automatically disburses the prize pool to the winners. This innovative feature enhances the integrity of events hosted on the platform and provides assurance to participants.


## How It Works

### User Registration and Gasless Transactions

1. **User Login**: Users log in to the platform using their email ID, initiating the creation or retrieval of a gasless smart wallet account (ERC-4337).

2. **Smart Wallet Benefits**: The smart wallet associated with the user's email ID enables gasless transactions, eliminating the need for a traditional EOA and simplifying the transaction process without signing complexities.

### Event Organization

1. **Event Initialization**: Organizers can initiate an event by providing details such as the prize pool and end date. They also mint a unique NFT as an achievement, which will be sent to the winners upon closing the event.

2. **Event Listing**: The initiated event is listed on the platform for users to participate.

### User Participation

1. **Event Participation**: Users can participate in listed events through their smart wallets, interacting seamlessly with the decentralized application.

2. **Transaction Simplicity**: Gasless transactions, facilitated by the smart wallet, enhance the user experience by reducing transaction complexities.

### Event Closure and Prize Distribution

1. **Closing the Event**: Upon the conclusion of the event, the organizer specifies the addresses of the winners.

2. **Smart Contract Interaction**: The specified addresses trigger interactions with the smart contract, leading to the distribution of the staked amount to the winners.

3. **Achievement NFT Reward**: Winners are rewarded with the achievement NFT, minted by the organizer during event initialization.
